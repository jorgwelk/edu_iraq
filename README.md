These files are part of a research project on education in Iraq. The descriptive analyses focus on children's and adolescents' educational participation, adults' educational attainment, and reasons why adults did not acquire or did not continue education. Code was mostly written on Jupyter Notebook. 
The figures represent a selection of the project's most relevant data visualizations. They are mainly based on Seaborn and Matplotlib. Some figures were created using Tableau.
This project's result will be a working paper which will shortly be published.
